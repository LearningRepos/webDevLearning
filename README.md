# webDevLearning

This repo is a compilation of projects built with Angela Yu's Web Development Course and Colt Steele's Advanced Web Development Course(both from Udemy) where I went from basic HTML and CSS to building a full fledged MERN Web Application.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install certain projects with Node inside them.

```bash
npm install .
```

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-Achyuta/webDevLearning.git
cd webDevLearning
cd randomProject
npm i .
```

## What I Learnt

I obviously did a deep dive into some of these concepts(aka Javascript) and sped through some modules without any hesitation (jQuery & Bootstrap) since they were either outdated(DOM Manipulation) or there were better alternatives(Tailwind/Materialize CSS)

1. **Angela Yu's Course:**
   HTML/CSS -> Javascript -> Bootstrap -> Javascript & The DOM -> jQuery -> Command Line -> Node -> Express -> APIS -> MySQL -> MongoDB/Mongoose -> REST APIS -> React

2. **Colt Steele's Course**
   CSS Animations -> Async/Await Promises -> AJAX Fetchers(Axios/jQuery/Fetch) -> Jasmine -> Closures -> ES 2015-17 -> Basic MERN Web Applications(Combining it all together)
